# Stacktician - CloudFormation web front-end for stackmate

[stackmate](https://github.com/chiradeep/stackmate.git) reads existing CloudFormation templates 
and executes them on a CloudStack deployment
Unlike CloudFormation, it does not (yet) run as a web application. 
Instead it runs everything on the client side. 

Stacktician embeds stackmate to provide the web front-end using a Rails application

## Dependencies

Stacktician uses [Bundler](http://gembundler.com/) to setup and maintain its
environment. Before running stackmate for the first time you need to install
Bundler (gem install bundler) and then run:

```bash
$ bundle install

```


## Getting started quickly

### Using the source

* Get the source files using git

```bash
$ git clone http://github.com/chiradeep/stacktician.git
$ cd stacktician
```

* Make sure every dependency is resolved

```bash
$ bundle install
```

* Create a seed of templates in the database

```bash
$ rake db:migrate
$ rake db:seed
```

* You can run Stacktician in NOOP mode: in this case it will not try to create resources on CloudStack, but just update the database with success. Before you run the Rails server:

```
$ export DEMO_MODE=NOOP
```

Otherwise, the following environment variables need to be set (change to your environment's specifics)

```
CS_URL=http://localhost:8080/client/api
CS_ADMIN_APIKEY=6b4IAqDFqSfpBqap1GEhKS4U8PIOpxnoS0tuAX46jXAiE7hCBO-l2zKvWm-FuyTQUFddfR59oNqMSUbSCZgoQw
CS_ADMIN_SECKEY=WM9HIBLc59XYhr2kCAS94eCrGp789cSYwSys1pgEUuV2_rhFxej8vds-sd9eMu6RtxM7Kk0K0k9G8Rtl1oxl-A
CS_LOCAL="---\nservice_offerings:\n  m1.small: 1c8db272-f95a-406c-bce3-39192ce965fa\ntemplates:\n  ami-1b814f72: 3ea4563e-c7eb-11e2-b0ed-7f3baba63e45\nzoneid: b3409835-02b0-4d21-bba4-1f659402117e\n"
```

CS_LOCAL is a YAML string that provides the mappings from AWS entities to your CloudStack entities.

* Heroku

There should be a demo app (NOOP mode) running at http://stacktician.herokuapp.com/
If you want to deploy to Heroku, you can use heroku config:set to set the environment variables.


* Stacktician lets you self-create a login. Sign in and create a Cloudformation stack!


## TODO
* Query-based API server (http://awsdocs.s3.amazonaws.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/qrc_cfn_api.pdf)
* Allow users to specify stack template URL
* Update stack / delete stack
* Metadata server to serve cfn-get-metadata
* Performance (use queue (Resque for ex)  to queue API jobs)
* Rollback
